CheapRuler

A collection of very fast approximations to common geodesic measurements. Useful for performance-sensitive code that measures things on a city scale (less than 500km, not near the poles). Can be an order of magnitude faster than Haversine based methods.

A Perl port of Mapbox's cheap-ruler v4.0.0 https://github.com/mapbox/cheap-ruler

Very fast as they use just 1 trig function per call.

The Maths model is based upon the Earth's actual shape (a squashed sphere). For 'city' scale work, it is more accurate than
the Haversine formulae (which uses several trig calls based upon a spherical Earth). The Cheap\_Ruler Github page explains it better!
